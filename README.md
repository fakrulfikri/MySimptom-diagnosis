A project for my university final year project (UKM)

# Check Symptom
A Flask Python program that is used as an API to determine the disease with the highest probability, based on given symptoms in Bahasa Melayu. Result (disease name) will also be in Bahasa Melayu. Algo idea by itachi9604/healthcare-chatbot and modified.

An absolute beginner. Any help and advice will be appreciated.

## Update
- Changed the symptom and disease database language to Bahasa Melayu.
- Automatic deploy to Heroku PaaS is enabled.
- The working repository has been backed up. 
- Stable version has been uploaded.

### How it works
- Use PaaS (Platform as a Service) website/platform to connect to the Git repositories.
- Make sure to set the Dyno type to web.
- Link the connected service as an API to other applications such as android apk.

### I/O
- Input: 5 symptoms from the documented symptoms/diseases data collection.
- Output: 1 possible disease based on symptoms given.

Will update more in the future.
